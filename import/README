GENERATE SQLITE tx.ExecuteSql() calls for the content table

two files with different formats, handled by the same script:
Be sure to create CSV's using "Quote All fields".

main content file, with fields:
import_id,type,title,deleted,body,Related content tags

litsing content file with fields:
"import_id","type","title","link","icon_class"

file formats are completely flexible though.

Note that "deleted" and "Related content tags" will be excluded from the import.
Deleted is respected to ignore rows however.
