Healthy New York
================
This is a mobile app in progress, built using PhoneGap/Cordova and Bootstrap.
Presently we are focusing on an Android release and testing against the Nexus 4.
Eventually we will target various devices and platforms.

TODOS
-----
* Package management for jQuery and Bootstrap, probably involving Grunt, Bower,
  and/or Cordova hooks. For the time being, files from other libraries (i.e.,
  jQuery and Bootstrap) have been committed to the www/js and www/css directories.
  This is suboptimal.
* Remove cruft from the Cordova Hello World app.
* Consider using LESS for nesting CSS rules, etc.
